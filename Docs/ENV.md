# General
 These are the environmental variables you need for your general server:
 
 

    1. The admin password for your server ("apw_hoi_gs").
    2. The regular password for your server ("rpw_hoi_gs").
    3. The super admin password for your server ("sapw_hoi_gs").
    4. The twilio account sid for your server ("hoi_t_account_sid").
    5. The twilio auth token for your server ("hoi_t_auth_token").
    6. The twilio phone number for your server ("hoi_t_phone_number").

If you are running a Postgres database with this system you will need:


    host  -> ("hoi_db_host")
    
    port -> ("hoi_db_port")
    
    database -> ("hoi_db_name")
    
    user -> ("hoi_db_user")     
    
    password  -> ("hoi_db_pw")

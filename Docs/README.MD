The HOI-GeneralServer is the connecting point all of the devices in a House of Iot System. All communication goes through the GeneralServer to and from bots/non-bots with enforced permissions by using the auth system. This server was designed to be easy to deploy and setup.

By default House-Of-Iot doesn't store any data for application operations, but you can configure the usage of a database for longer historic tracking and other features that require a database.

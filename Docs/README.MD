The HOI-GeneralServer is the connecting point all of the devices in a House of Iot System. All communication goes through the GeneralServer to and from bots/non-bots with enforced permissions by using the auth system. This server was designed to be easy to deploy and setup.

 Are you tired of setting up databases and external services to run extremely simple systems? House of Iot doesn't use any outside services to run the server, no databases or message brokers. It is as simple as setting a few pre-settings, running `python3 main.py` and connecting your smart devices .

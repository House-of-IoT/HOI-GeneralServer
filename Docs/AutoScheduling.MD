# How does Auto Scheduling work? 
Auto scheduling is a feature that allows you to pre-schedule actions. This feature is most-helpful when you would like to automatically control devices
without having to manually use a non-bot client to control them. A great example of this would be setting a time for an automated sprinkler system to turn on at
a specific time in the day.

# Notifications


For notifications we decided to keep it simple by using text messages that uses a configurable list of contacts. This removes need for having the MobileClient and 
provides a wider range of support. The current server notifications use twilio and requires the server's master to have a twilio account setup. One you have a
twilio account you can use you tokens for the server with custom alerts.
